# Suzanna S.
Math and data science student interested in the intersection of complex biological problems with changing technological capabilities. Specialties include machine learning in R/Python, differential equation modeling in MATLAB, and querying in SQL. Here are some projects I've worked on in internships, the classroom, and just for fun :)
