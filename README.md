I'm a math major interested in asset management and trading. I have experience using R, Python, MATLAB, and LaTeX, and am eager to learn more.
Here you'll find some projects I've worked on.

## Optimal Control Theory with MATLAB
[Project 1](https://github.com/suzannasem/Bacterial_Growth): Bacteria Growth with Chemical Nutrient and Hindering Byproduct.

[Project 2](https://github.com/suzannasem/HIV_Chemo/tree/main): Optimal Control Applied to Chemotherapy of Reverse Transcription Inhibitors for HIV.

[Project 3](https://github.com/suzannasem/Predator_Pest): Optimal Control for Pesticide Treatments of Predator-Prey Populations.

## Statistics with R
