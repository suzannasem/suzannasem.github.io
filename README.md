# Suzanna S.
Math and data science student interested in the intersection of complex biological problems with changing technological capabilities. Specialties include machine learning in R/Python, differential equation modeling in MATLAB, and querying in SQL. Here are some projects I've worked on in internships, the classroom, and just for fun :)

## Computational Neuroscience
Includes neural networks, PCA, and reinforcement learning: [Full Repo](https://github.com/suzannasem/compneuro) contains 5 projects in Python.

## Modeling Lesion Growth in Endometriosis
Work associated with my thesis research (WIP). [Link](https://github.com/suzannasem/endo)

## Tufts University VERSE REU
[ArXiv Paper](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2503.19236)

[Poster: Constraints on Corrections to General Relativity Using the Cassini Probe](https://github.com/suzannasem/General_Relativity/tree/main)

## Bayesian Statistics with R
[Analyzing Effects of PPE Type on Post-H2S Exposure Cognitive Performance](https://github.com/suzannasem/masking_exposure/tree/main)

## Optimal Control Theory with MATLAB
[Project 1](https://github.com/suzannasem/Bacterial_Growth): Bacteria Growth with Chemical Nutrient and Hindering Byproduct.

[Project 2](https://github.com/suzannasem/HIV_Chemo/tree/main): Optimal Control Applied to Chemotherapy of Reverse Transcription Inhibitors for HIV.

[Project 3](https://github.com/suzannasem/Predator_Pest): Optimal Control for Pesticide Treatments of Predator-Prey Populations.

## Evolutionary Game Theory

## Mathematical Models in Applied Biological Contexts
[Final Project](https://github.com/suzannasem/pancreatic_cell_model/tree/main): Incorporating Delta-Cells in Pancreatic Islet Cell Models to Examine the Efficacy of Somatostatin Treatment on Type II Diabetes.

## Measles Vaccination Data Analysis (Python) - WIP
